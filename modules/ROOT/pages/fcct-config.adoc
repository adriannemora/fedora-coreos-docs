= Provisioning and Configuration

== Introduction
This document provides the configuration specification for human-friendly FCOS Configuration (FCC) YAML files. Once written, use the FCOS Configuration Transpiler, `fcct`, to convert the YAML file into the machine-friendly JSON Ignition file.

Ignition files specify the configuration of FCOS and are ingested upon first boot of FCOS. Upon subsequent boots of the FCOS machine, the Ignition file is not used.

== FCCT Configuration Specification

Refer to the https://github.com/coreos/fcct/blob/master/docs/configuration-v1_0.md[Configuration Specification] for a full list of options.
