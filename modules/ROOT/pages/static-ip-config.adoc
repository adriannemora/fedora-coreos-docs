= Configuring FCOS to Use a Static IP Address
By default, an FCOS instance will attempt to grab a DHCP address from the local network. However, if you need FCOS to use a static IP address, you can do so by specifying the NetworkManager configuration in the Ignition configuration file.

As with any custom configuration on FCOS, you can write specific files in the xref:ign-storage.adoc[`storage` node] of the Ignition file.

The following snippet shows how to assign the following to eth0:

* static IP: `192.0.2.10/24`
* gateway: `192.0.2.1`
* DNS: `92.168.124.1;1.1.1.1;8.8.8.8`
* DNS search domain: `redhat.com`

NOTE: During the initramfs portion of the boot process, dracut will attempt to grab a DHCP address. When it times out, Ignition will take over and write the above configuration into the filesystem.

If the interface does not come up correctly on first boot, issue the following commands to force the static IP to take effect:

`nmcli connection down eth0`

`nmcli connection up eth0`
